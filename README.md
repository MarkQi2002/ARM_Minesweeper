## Game Description
- Minesweeper is a singl-player puzzle video game. The objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them. The player will gain hint regarding the location of the mines from the number of neighbouring mines in each field. <br />
- The game was originated from the 1960s. <br />
- Microsoft Minesweeper was included in the standard install of Windows 3.1 in 1992.

## Project Description
- This is the final course project for ECE 243 Winter 2022 at University of Toronto worth 5.6% of the total mark. <br />
- We used C as the predominant language to code the game and implemented on the physical DE1-SoC board. <br />
- The program can also be simulated using an online tool called CPUlator, which can be assessed at https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc. <br />
